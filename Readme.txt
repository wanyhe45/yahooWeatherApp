Assignment 3
Wanying He


For this assignment, I spent a lot of time on Javascript. I finish most of the requirement on this assignment, except for the resize part. I cannot get the first 5 forecast box to be fix when the window is narrow down. I try to use onresize=”function” in my code, but it is not working as I expected.


 I did not use the font the TA provided, because I cannot find a free one. So I ended up using a font: Prompt. 


For the folder submission, I use WeatherApp.
